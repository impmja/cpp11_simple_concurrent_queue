# c++11 Simple Concurrent Queue

The Simple Concurrent Queue implementation is heavily based on the works of Alfredo Pons (http://gnodebian.blogspot.com.es/2013/07/a-thread-safe-asynchronous-queue-in-c11.html) with little addons.

The Thread Safe cout implementation is also almost 1:1 based on the works of Howard Hinnant (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18277304/using-stdcout-in-multiple-threads) with a little addon.

So, props to these guys for their awesome work!
